# Unreal Ability System Prototype (C++)

A third-person prototype demonstrating **Unreal Engine C++ gameplay systems architecture** — ability slots, projectile abilities, interface-based damage, and an event-driven HUD.

---

## Systems implemented

- **Ability system** — `UAbility` (UObject) instanced per slot via `UAbilityComponent` (UActorComponent), per-slot independent cooldowns, Blueprint-tunable via subclassing
- **Interface-based damage** — `IDamageable` UINTERFACE decouples projectile from enemy class; any actor implementing the interface can receive damage
- **Event-driven HUD** — `FOnSlotChanged` Dynamic Multicast Delegate drives slot updates; dynamic widget creation with no hard-coded slot count

## Controls

| Key | Action |
|-----|--------|
| `1` | Trigger slot 0 — Single Projectile |
| `2` | Trigger slot 1 — Burst (3 projectiles) |
| `3` / `4` | Unequipped slots (no ability assigned) |
| `WASD` | Move |
| `Mouse` | Look |
| `Escape` | Quit |

## Architecture overview

Abilities are `UObject` subclasses instanced per slot by `UAbilityComponent` (`UActorComponent`). Each slot holds its own ability instance with independent cooldown state. The component broadcasts an `FOnSlotChanged` delegate on equip and trigger — the HUD binds to it without the component knowing the HUD exists.

Projectile abilities spawn `AAbilityProjectile` actors which apply damage through the `IDamageable` interface — the projectile has no dependency on any specific enemy class.

See [TECHNICAL.md](Docs/TECHNICAL.md) for full implementation details and design decisions.

## Known limitations

- No multiplayer / replication
- No object pooling for projectiles
- Keyboard and mouse only (no controller support)
- Not broadly hardware tested

---

## What I would improve next

- Implement object pooling for projectiles
- Add a C++ base for common projectile variants (homing, bouncing) to further demonstrate the extensibility of `AAbilityProjectile`
